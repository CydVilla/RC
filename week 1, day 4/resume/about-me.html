        <h2>I'm the Developer you need.</p>
            <p>I strive to constantly grow as a person and a developer. What sets me apart is my strong desire to see
                everything through and continue to learn every step of the way.</p>
            <p>Once I began programming I made a commitment to be a life-long learner. I am motivated by this never
                ending pursuit for knowledge and to use these skills I have developed to make my dreams and those of my
                family true. Like Master Yoda always said "Do. Or do not. There is no try."</p>
